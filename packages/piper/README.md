# Piper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kofno/piper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kofno/piper)

Functional composition in Typescript

_pipe_ is pretty much strait-up stolen from [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/f8a9d6e52f6ab151d08da0e7424f64f70763c830/src/internal/util/pipe.ts)

Also, I wanted to release a library named after my cat. She is glorious.
